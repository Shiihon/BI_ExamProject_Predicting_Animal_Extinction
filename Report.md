# **Predicting animal extinction**

## In the face of accelerating biodiversity loss and climate change, this project aims to predict which animal species are at greatest risk of extinction by analyzing patterns in their biological traits and environmental conditions. It combines comprehensive datasets of species-specific characteristics (e.g., lifespan, reproductive rate, habitat type, diet, conservation status) with historical climate data (such as country-level temperature trends) to incorporate both intrinsic biological factors and external environmental pressures into the analysis. Using this integrated data, the project employs a suite of analytical techniques—including classification algorithms (such as Decision Tree models), clustering analysis, and data visualization tools—to identify key patterns and build a predictive model for extinction risk. By highlighting vulnerable species before they become critically endangered, this data-driven approach provides early warning insights and underscores the importance of predictive modeling in guiding biodiversity conservation efforts.

### **Research questions**
* Can we build a model that predicts which animals are likely to become endangered next?
* Which traits (biological or environmental) are the strongest indicators of future extinction risk?
* Is there a measurable link between rising climate pressure (e.g. temperature increase) and species vulnerability?
* How does the combination of climate data and species-specific features improve prediction compared to using only one data type?

### **Hypothesis**
* Animals with low reproductive output (few offspring, long gestation) are more likely to face extinction.
* Species located in countries with sharply rising temperatures are at higher risk.
* Carnivorous species are more vulnerable due to higher food chain dependence and niche sensitivity.
* Habitat type and social structure will improve extinction prediction accuracy when modeled alongside climate data.
* A model combining both biological and climate indicators will outperform single-source models.

### **Data Sources**
* [Animal Dataset(Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-information-dataset?resource=download)

* [Climate Dataset (World Bank Climate Change Data Portal)](https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/download-data)

### **Description of both datasets**
#### ***Animal Dataset***
* The animal dataset contains biological and ecological information about a wide range of animal species. Each record includes features such as conservation status, body mass, lifespan, diet, reproductive traits, and geographical distribution. One of the key columns, Country Found, includes a mix of specific countries (e.g., Kenya, India) and broad regions (e.g., Africa, Asia), which presented a challenge for direct geographical alignment with climate data.

#### ***Climate Dataset***
* The climate dataset includes climate indicators (e.g., temperature change, CO₂ levels, precipitation) associated with specific countries. Unlike the animal dataset, this dataset uses only standardized country names without any regional aggregates.

### **Regional Mapping and Merging Strategy**
#### To connect the two datasets for analysis, a unified geographical structure was necessary. Since the animal dataset included both countries and regions while the climate dataset only referenced countries, a preprocessing step was performed:
* Five geographical regions were defined: Africa, Asia, Europe, Americas, and Oceania.

* All countries in the climate dataset were assigned to one of these five regions.

* Animals were also mapped to these regions based on the countries or regions listed in the Country Found column.

* Each animal was duplicated for every region it was found in. For example, if an animal existed in both Africa and Asia, it appeared in the dataset twice, once for each region.

* These duplicates were later removed to ensure a clean dataset, resulting in a one-to-one mapping per region per animal.

### **Considerations and Limitations**
#### This regional mapping allowed for the datasets to be merged effectively on a shared geographical level (region). However, this approach introduces certain limitations:

* By generalizing location data from specific countries to broader regions, some granularity is lost. Localized climate effects might not align perfectly with region-wide averages.

* The presence of duplicates due to multi-region presence of animals introduced redundancy, which had to be addressed during preprocessing.

* A more precise solution would have involved mapping each animal to every country it exists in and then joining with exact country-level climate data. Due to time constraints, this was not feasible in the current project scope, but it is a clear direction for future work to improve the precision and reliability of the analysis.

### **Exploration Summary**
#### Exploratory data analysis included a variety of visualizations such as bar charts, countplots, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps to uncover patterns in the data. For example, bar charts of social structure revealed that highly social species (those living in packs or large groups) have a notably higher proportion of at-risk species compared to solitary species. This was somewhat surprising, as one might assume solitary animals to be more vulnerable; instead, pack-based and group-based species showed the highest extinction risk rates. A correlation analysis confirmed the relationship was present but weak in linear terms (social structure vs. risk) due to the categorical nature of the data. Nevertheless, these barplots and a corresponding countplot (at-risk vs. not at-risk counts per social category) highlighted that while solitary animals were the most common in the dataset, a smaller fraction of them were at risk, whereas socially structured animals, though fewer in number, were frequently at risk. 
#### This pattern suggests that complex social systems may not buffer species against environmental stress as previously assumed. Geographic trends were also explored: species inhabiting regions with greater temperature increases tended to be more at risk, hinting at a link between climate change and vulnerability. Additionally, analyses by diet were conducted. A diet-type countplot indicated that herbivorous species actually had a large number of threatened species, sometimes even more than carnivores, whereas omnivores showed relatively fewer at-risk cases. This finding challenged the expectation that carnivores would be the dominant at-risk group. 
#### Combining climate data with these biological facets, boxplots were generated to compare recent temperature changes in regions for at-risk vs. non-at-risk species. For instance, pack-based species at risk were found to inhabit regions with higher average temperature shifts in the last century. In summary, the Sprint 2 exploration produced key insights: socially gregarious animals and certain diet groups (e.g. large herbivores) show elevated extinction risk, and there are observable correlations suggesting species in areas of higher climate warming face greater threats. These insights informed the modeling strategies and feature selection in subsequent steps.

### **Model Building**
#### Multiple classification methods were implemented to predict the extinction risk of species. In particular, the project experimented with algorithms such as Decision Tree classifiers, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to distinguish at-risk species from others.
#### The models were built using scikit-learn, following a typical supervised learning workflow. The cleaned and engineered dataset was divided into training and testing subsets (e.g. using an 80/20 split), ensuring that model performance could be evaluated on unseen data. 
#### During training, cross-validation and grid search were employed in some cases for hyperparameter tuning (for example, trying different depths for decision trees or kernel types for SVM) to improve generalization. Each model was trained on the training set with the binary target label at_risk, and their predictions were validated on the hold-out test set. Consistent procedures were applied for fairness: all models saw the same training data and were assessed with the same metrics. 
#### The use of multiple algorithms allowed comparison between simpler linear models and more complex nonlinear ones. For instance, the Decision Tree provided interpretability in terms of feature importance, while Logistic Regression offered a baseline probabilistic approach, and the SVM could potentially capture nonlinear boundaries. Throughout model building, careful attention was paid to avoid overfitting – techniques such as pruning decision trees and regularization in logistic and SVM were considered. The end result was a set of trained classifiers whose performance could be directly compared, enabling selection of the best model for each dataset variant (biological features only, climate features only, and the combined dataset).

### **Feature Engineering**
#### Before modeling, substantial data cleaning and feature engineering were performed to prepare the dataset. One major task was handling the geographic data: the “Country Found” field in the animal dataset included both specific countries and broad regions (e.g. entries like “Kenya” alongside “Africa”), which posed a challenge for merging with country-level climate data.
#### This was addressed by mapping broad region labels to specific countries or otherwise reconciling them with the climate dataset so that each species could be associated with a definite location. After alignment, geographical categories were encoded using one-hot encoding to avoid implying any ordinal relationship between different regions. Similarly, other categorical features such as Diet, Habitat, and Social Structure were transformed into numeric form. In many cases one-hot encoding was applied (for example, creating binary indicator columns for each diet category or habitat type) so that the models could effectively use these features. The target variable, conservation status, was simplified into a binary label at_risk. Various detailed status values (Least Concern, Vulnerable, Endangered, etc.) were mapped into two classes: “at risk” (for statuses indicating any level of threat such as Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered) versus “not at risk” (for Least Concern and similar lower-risk statuses). 
#### This mapping provided a clear prediction target in line with the project’s goal of flagging species likely to become endangered. Further preprocessing steps included handling missing values and outliers – for instance, if any species had undefined trait values, those were either imputed or that record removed to ensure a clean dataset. Numerical features (e.g. lifespan, body mass, speed, gestation period, number of offspring) were scaled into comparable ranges for the algorithms.
#### A scaling technique such as Min-Max normalization or standardization was used so that features with larger units (like body weight in kg) would not dominate others (like offspring count). Feature engineering also involved creating new features where relevant; for example, a temp_change feature was derived from the climate data to represent the magnitude of temperature increase in each species’ region over the last century. This quantified climate pressure experienced by each species. By the end of this process, the data was well-integrated, with a rich set of predictors describing each species’ biology (reproductive traits, diet, habitat, etc.) and environment (regional climate trends), all in a machine-learning-ready format.

### **Performance Comparison**
#### The models were evaluated using standard classification metrics, with a focus on accuracy, recall, precision, and the F1-score to balance the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives. Overall, the comparative results showed that the choice of features (biology, climate, or combined) had a significant impact on predictive performance. Models trained on the combined dataset (incorporating both species traits and climate variables) consistently outperformed those trained on a single type of feature. For example, the best combined-data model achieved the highest accuracy and F1-score, indicating better overall correctness and balance.
#### In contrast, models using only biological features (such as reproductive traits, diet, etc.) performed moderately well but missed some cases that the climate information could help catch. Likewise, the climate-only model was the weakest, sometimes only slightly above a baseline predictor – unsurprising, since using only climatic factors (like temperature change and region) provides an incomplete picture of extinction risk. Among the algorithms tested, the Decision Tree classifier on the combined dataset emerged as a top performer in terms of F1-score and interpretability. It was able to capture nonlinear interactions between biological and environmental features, giving it an edge in identifying at-risk species. 
#### The tree’s advantage was especially clear in recall for the at-risk class: it correctly identified a larger fraction of truly threatened species, an important consideration for conservation-focused predictions. The logistic regression and SVM models also performed respectably on the combined data, with logistic regression providing a useful baseline (its accuracy was slightly lower than the tree’s, but it offered insight into feature significance via its coefficients). The SVM (with an RBF kernel) improved on logistic in capturing some complex patterns, but at the cost of less interpretability.
#### In the biology-only scenario, the models tended to have lower recall – for instance, some species flagged by climate trends would be missed if climate data were excluded. Conversely, the climate-only model had poor precision, flagging many species as at risk that were actually not threatened, presumably because climate stress alone isn’t a definitive predictor without the biological context. By quantitatively comparing these outcomes, the project confirmed that the combined approach yielded the most robust predictions, supporting the hypothesis that an integrative model performs best. It also highlighted differences between algorithms: the decision tree’s ability to leverage feature interactions gave it a slight performance boost, whereas the linear model struggled with some nonlinear patterns, and the SVM required careful tuning to generalize well. All results were derived from the test set evaluation, ensuring that the comparison reflected each model’s ability to predict new data.
### **Results & Insights**
#### Analyzing the fitted models provided deeper insights into which factors are most indicative of extinction risk. A key finding was that life-history and reproductive traits play a crucial role in the predictions. Species with very low reproductive rates – for example, those having few offspring per year or very long gestation periods – were strongly associated with the at-risk class, aligning with the first hypothesis that slow breeders are more vulnerable. In fact, the decision tree’s feature importance and the logistic regression’s coefficients both pointed to reproductive metrics (like number of offspring) as top predictors, reflecting that species which replenish their populations slowly tend to be at higher risk of decline. Another important set of features were the environmental/climate indicators. The inclusion of the temperature change variable (the degree of warming in a species’ range over the past century) notably improved the model’s ability to identify threatened species. Species experiencing greater historical climate warming had higher predicted probabilities of being at risk, suggesting a measurable link between climate pressure and vulnerability. This confirms that climate factors, while not the sole cause of extinction risk, do contribute significant predictive power when combined with biology.
####  Interestingly, some traits did not influence the models exactly as expected. For instance, the hypothesis that carnivorous species are more vulnerable was only partially supported – our models did flag many carnivores as at risk, but they also highlighted numerous at-risk herbivores. The data showed that diet alone is not a definitive risk indicator: both large carnivores and large herbivores appeared frequently in the at-risk group. The model’s behavior reflected this, as diet features had a more modest importance compared to reproductive traits or climate factors. Another insight was related to social structure. 
#### The EDA had shown pack-living animals often being at risk, and the models indeed found social structure to be a useful feature (e.g., whether a species is solitary or group-living contributed to the predictions). However, its effect was nuanced: while highly social species often face threats (perhaps because many are large, wide-ranging predators or herbivores affected by habitat loss), being solitary did not guarantee safety either. Overall, the addition of climate data did improve the predictions. The combined model not only had higher accuracy but was especially better at catching true at-risk cases (higher recall) than the biology-only model, indicating that climate stressors provide complementary information. That said, the improvement was incremental rather than overwhelming – in other words, many at-risk species were identifiable from their intrinsic traits alone, but climate data helped capture some borderline cases or added confidence to the predictions.
#### One unexpected result was the relationship between sociality and risk: initially, one might assume solitary species would suffer more from threats like habitat fragmentation, yet our findings showed that highly social species were often more at risk. This counterintuitive pattern suggests that social species (e.g. those that hunt or migrate in groups) might be particularly sensitive to environmental changes or human pressures, perhaps because their need for cooperative behaviors (like pack hunting or communal nesting) makes them vulnerable when their population numbers drop. The models took such patterns into account, as evidenced by their higher risk estimates for those group-living species. 
#### In summary, the results underscored that a mix of biological traits (especially reproductive rate, body size, and social/habitat characteristics) and climate factors (notably temperature trends) together determine a species’ risk status. No single trait dominates the prediction; instead, it’s the combination – for example, a large herbivore with slow reproduction in a rapidly warming region would be flagged as high-risk by our model, which matches real-world observations in conservation biology. These insights not only validate several of our hypotheses but also reveal the complex, multifaceted nature of extinction risk.
