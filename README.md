Wildlife at Risk: Predicting Animal Extinction Using Biological and Environmental Factors

### Brainstorm
After exploring different domains where Business Intelligence could provide real-world value, I decided to focus on wildlife conservation. I was inspired by the rich animal characteristics dataset available online, which contains extensive data on traits like lifespan, habitat, speed, diet, and conservation status. To enhance the analysis with environmental context, I combined it with a global climate dataset from the World Bank Climate Knowledge Portal, which offers country-level yearly average temperature data from 1901 to 2023.

This project aims to go beyond understanding existing threats â€” the goal is to predict which animals may be at risk of extinction next, based on patterns in their biology and climate conditions. This could help highlight vulnerable species before it's too late, and inform data-driven conservation strategies.

### Brief annotation
This project addresses the challenge of forecasting future extinction risks by analyzing both animal traits and climate data. This is an important research goal, as early prediction can inform preventative action and guide conservation funding. The expected outcome is a predictive model that highlights species likely to become endangered based on known risk patterns. This solution could support researchers, NGOs, and environmental policymakers in identifying and protecting species before they disappear.
